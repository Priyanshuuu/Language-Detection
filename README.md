# Language-Detection


## What is Language Detection?

Language Detection comes in the category of NLP (Natural Language Processing), which involves the study regarding how computers can decode a code and value from human language.

It deals with the problem of determining which natural language given content is in.

## Need For Language Identification

Natural Language models are usually specific to a discrete language. If one is not sure of the receiving document’s language, it becomes very hard to provide anyone with a good experience.

Wouldn’t it be great, if a technical support chatbot is made capable to determine a speaker’s language and could reply with documentation in the same language?

NLP algorithms have to be modified for different corpus and in accordance with the grammar of different languages.

Certain NLP software is best suited for certain languages, such as NLTK and FreeLing.

NLTK is the most favored natural language processing package for English under Python, but FreeLing is best for Spanish.

The effectiveness of language processing depends on various factors.

A superior quality model for text analysis includes the following:

**1. Text Extraction**: Text can be extracted by web data extraction, importing it in a particular format, grabbing it from a database, or obtain it through an API.

**2. Text Identification**: It is a process of separating interesting text from another format that adds noise to the analysis

**3. NLP**: It is a set of algorithms that support the processing of different languages.

**4. Machine Learning**: It is an essential step for objectives such as collaborative, sentiment analysis and clustering.

 

 

***Software Options*** There are a lot of languages recognizing software available online. NLTLK use Crúbadán, whereas Gate includes TexCat.

We prefer using Google Language API because it is very precise even for just one word. It consists of an accuracy measure in return.

## Language detection with Python

long detect is one derived directly from Google's language detection. From the home page of the Python library, you can get access to the project page, this seems to be different from the code on which the R library CLDR is based. And in fact, the Python library seems to be well organized and maintained.

It claims it can detect 55 languages and upon a simple call to the function “detect” will return the two-letter iso code of the language detect while a call to detect Lang will return a vector of probabilities strings. The vector contains a single item.

## Combination of Python and NLTK for Language Detection

Most of us are involved in search engines and Social networks to show data in certain languages, for example, Spanish and English.

To accomplish this process, an indexed text has to be examined well which would give an intended result and store it together.
